These files contain a simple hack to the elk code to produce ELF.OUT
and VCL.OUT files with the clm-style description of the elf and the
Coulomb potential. The patch applies to the 1.3.2 version of elk, but
it is easy to adapt to newer versions of the code. Use the new OUT
files with critic2 like this:

LOAD STATE.OUT GEOMETRY.OUT ELF.OUT
LOAD STATE.OUT GEOMETRY.OUT VCL.OUT

-- A.
