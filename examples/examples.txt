List of critic2 examples
------------------------

To run these examples, you will need the data files (structures,
densities, etc.). You can download them from:

http://schooner.chem.dal.ca/downloads/critic2/critic2_examples_data.tar.xz

Uncompress the archive inside the examples/ subdirectory (creates
examples/data/). Or, alternatively, by navigating to examples/ and
running the fetch_data.sh script.

* zhurova_tsirelson_srtio3

** Density source: WIEN2k 
** System: SrTiO3 perovskite crystal
** Reference: Zhurova and Tsirelson, Acta Cryst. B (2002) 58, 567-575.

** Description

This example tries to reproduce and expand the results for the SrTiO3
perovskite in:

  Zhurova and Tsirelson, Acta Cryst. B (2002) 58, 567-575.

In contrast to the article, we use the LAPW densities (at the same
calculation parameters) directly, rather than using the calculated
structure factors and a multipolar model. The WIEN2k density and
struct files are provided in the data/ directory, as well as the
runwien input (.wien).

** table2.cri
Automatic search for the critical points of the electron density, and
calculation of the G(r), V(r), and H(r) energy densities at those
points, using the Kirzhnits approximation. 

** basin_shapes.cri
Three-dimensional representation of the atomic basins. Two plots are
made: just the atomic basins, and the same basins with the kinetic
energy density (gtf) color-mapped on the basin surface. 

** figure2.cri
Automatic search for all critical points of the density. Then,
three-dimensional plot of the topological graph (the density gradient
lines connecting atoms through bcps). Also, a three-dimensional
representation of the Sr basin using gradient paths. 

** figure3.cri
Search for critical points, then plots of electron density contours
combined with gradient lines on two different crystallographic planes:
(001) and (222). 

** figure5a.cri
Define the Thomas-Fermi potential energy density (vtf_kir) as a ghost
field, then calculate its critical points, and make the following
plots: a three-dimensional representation of the topological graph for
this field, and a contour plot with gradient lines on the (001) plane.

** figure5b.cri
Define the Thomas-Fermi kinetic energy density (gtf_kir) as a ghost
field, then calculate its critical points, and make the following
plots: a three-dimensional representation of the topological graph for
this field, and a contour plot with gradient lines on the (001) plane.

** figure6-7.cri
Calculate the deformation potential energy density and the deformation
kinetic energy density on the (110) plane. These quantities are
defined as the difference between the potential (kinetic) energy
density obtained using the self-consistent density and that those
obtained from the promolecular density (the sum of atomic
densities). Relief plots are used to present the data.

** more.cri
Locate all the critical points in the unit cell, then integrate the
atomic basin properties (charge and volume) using qtree.

* auto_simple_promolecular

** Density source: none (internal density tables)
** System: pyrazole crystal at the experimental geometry
** Description 

This example (pyrazole.cri) shows how to use the automatic CP search
routine in a simple system: the pyrazole molecular crystal (72 atoms
in the unit cell) with the promolecular density (the sum of atomic
densities). The default automatic search fails to find all critical
points in this case, so an extended seeding strategy needs to be
used. The critical points are written to a obj file for visualization.

* nciplot_surf_kaolinite

** Density source: Quantum ESPRESSO
** System: kaolinite surface (slab) with an adsorbed benzene molecule
** Reference: Johnson and Otero-de-la-Roza, J. Chem. Theory Comput. (2012) 8, 5124.
** Description

The input files (kaoben_hl.cri and kaoben_hb.cri) generate the
NCIplots for benzene adsorbed on both sides (hydrophilic and
hydrophobic) of a kaolinite surface slab. The plots are the same as in
figure 2 of:

  Johnson and Otero-de-la-Roza, J. Chem. Theory Comput. (2012) 8, 5124.

In both cases, the input should be run in two steps. In the first
step, the structure is read and the unit cell is written to an xyz
file. The user then should extract from this xyz the relevant
fragments (using, for instance, a program like avogadro). Those xyz
files are used in the subsequent nciplot run. For convenience, the xyz
files are provided, along with the self-consistent QE electron
density. 

The files generated by nciplot can be opened with vmd (File -> Load
visualization state...).

* electride_yt

** Density source: Quantum ESPRESSO
** System: the K(cryptand-2.2.2) electride (CSD refcode GAVFIS)
** Reference: Dale, Otero-de-la-Roza, and Johnson, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 16 (2014) 14584.
** Description

The K(cryptand-2.2.2) electride (refcode GAVFIS) from the above
reference. 

** GAVFIS10_yt.cri

The pseudo-electron density and the reconstructed valence electron
density are used to integrated the atomic charges and volumes,
including the non-nuclear maximum in the crystal voids. This is done
using a grid integration method (Yu-Trinkle algorithm), and takes
several minutes. The positions of the non-nuclear maxima found by YT
are written to an obj file, and included into the CP list.

** GAVFIS10_promol.cri

The promolecular density is calculated on a grid with the same number
of points as the selfconsistent density from Quantum ESPRESSO, then
saved to a cube file. This data can be used to generate the plot in
Figure 5 using vmd.
