## Load the molecular structure and the wavefunction for pyridine
## (Gaussian wfx file).
molecule ../data/pyridine.wfx
load ../data/pyridine.wfx

## Load the LOL function for this system. This is a ghost field
## (its value is calculated from the expression every time the 
## field is evaluated) so the derivatives are numerical.  
load as "lol(1)" id lol

## Set the LOL function as the reference field
reference lol

## Find the critical points. The LOL has critical points outside the
## molecular plane, so the default seeding strategy (between pairs of
## atoms) needs to be augmented. Several attempts may be needed before
## the correct seeding strategy is found - the verbose and chk
## keywords are useful in this regard.
auto verbose chk \
      seed oh depth 3 x0 0. 0. 0. radius 5. nr 16 \
      seed pair npts 12

## Write a graphics file for visualization with avogadro (requires
## tweaking openbabel's element.txt, see manual).
